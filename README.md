# Cable Count

This is a project I'm making to improve my understanding of Java, SpringBoot, React, and MongoDB. The application is used to keep a track of cables around the house, as I've found a lot of duplicate cables around the home after recently organising them. I found 6 HDMI cables, some bought as recently as last year!

One of the main features I hope to create with this app is to export the data as a csv spreadsheet, with all the cables in the database.

Despite being a somewhat small project, I'm excited to learn more about these technologies and frameworks, applying it to a problem I've noticed keeps popping up here and there. I intend to begin with creating a locally hosted webapp, and hope to dockerize and make this application accessible for everyone.

npm packages used (so far): material ui, react-sidebar, antd (antdesign)
